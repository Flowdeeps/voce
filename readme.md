# VOCE for Processing

A library for Speech-to-Text (and Text-to-Speech) for [Processing](http://www.processing.org).   


## About 

* Based on the [VOCE library](http://voce.sourceforge.net/) by [Tyler Streeter](http://www.tylerstreeter.net)
* [Speech Recognition Example](examples/recognitionTest) adapted for Processing
* Tested with Processing 3.0.1 on OS X
* This is just a quick hack (More work needed to turn this into a fully fledged Processing library)

## License
